 ###Object Oriented Programming

This repository exist to do my next class in the college course offered by Southwest Tech.

I am someone who loves videogames and am constantly wanting to deeper my understanding of them from their designs, their programming and even how they break from certain unexpected actions. I am working on starting to make my own game in a engine called GamerMakersStudio. I am a fan of most types of music and also hope to be able to write a song for my games eventually too.

This is also the reason I want to become a programmer as my job, because I am going to be doing it in my own time anyway so why not make programming, even if not in gaming, my job.
